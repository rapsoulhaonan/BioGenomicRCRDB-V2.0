## What is EpiDenovo?
<dl>
<dd>
EpiDenovo is a database for annotation of the associations between embryonic epigenomes and DNMs in developmental disorders, including several neuropsychiatric disorders and congenital heart disease. EpiDenovo provides an easy-to-use web interface allowing users rapidly to find the epigenetic signatures of DNMs and the expression patterns of the genes that they regulate during embryonic development. In summary, EpiDenovo is a useful resource for selecting candidate genes for further functional studies in embryonic development of human and mouse, and for investigating DNMs causing or underlying developmental disorders of human.
