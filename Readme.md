## Epigenetic regulation in early mammalian development

Starting from fertilization and ending with implantation, preimplantation embryo development can be divided into several well-orchestrated stages: fertilization, cell cleavage, morula and blastocyst formation. During these stages, maternal and zygotic epigenetic factors play crucial roles. The gene expression profile is changed dramatically, chromatin is modified and core histone elements undergo significant changes. Each preimplantation embryo stage has its own characteristic epigenetic profile, consistent with the acquisition of the capacity to support development. Moreover, histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation as well as other epigenetic events can act as regulatory switches of gene transcription. Because the epigenetic profile is largely related to differentiation, epigenetic dysfunction can give rise to developmental abnormalities. Thus, epigenetic profiling of the embryo is of pivotal importance clinically. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consistently show that a substantial proportion of genetic risk for common disease falls within regions exhibiting chromatin accessibility in disease-relevant tissues or cell types. Given the importance of these aspects, this platform eMED (Fig. 1) mainly focuses on the epigenetic profiles of transcription factors and chromatin states during preimplantation embryo development, as well as interactions between epigenetic and genetic regulation in these early developmental stages. Understanding the stages of preimplantation development and the underlying regulatory molecular mechanisms is of pivotal importance for basic reproductive biology and for practical applications including regenerative medicine.
