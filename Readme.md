De novo mutations (DNMs) have been shown to be a major cause of
severe early-onset genetic disorders such as autism spectrum disorder
and intellectual disability. Over one million DNMs have been identified
in developmental disorders by next generation sequencing, but linking
these DNMs to the genes that they impact remains a challenge, as most
are embedded in non-coding regions. As most developmental diseases
occur in the early stages of development or during childhood, it is
crucial to clarify the details of epigenetic regulation in early
development in order to interpret the mechanisms underlying
developmental disorders, such as neuropsychiatric disorders and
congenital heart disease. Here, we describe the development of
EpiDenovo, a database that is freely available at
http://61.148.58.210:8080/EpiDenovo/, and which provides the
annotation of the associations between embryonic epigenomes and
DNMs in developmental disorders, including several neuropsychiatric

disorders and congenital heart disease. EpiDenovo provides an easy-to-
use web interface allowing users rapidly to find the epigenetic signatures

of DNMs and the expression patterns of the genes that they regulate
during embryonic development. In summary, EpiDenovo is a useful
resource for selecting candidate genes for further functional studies in
embryonic development, and for investigating DNMs causing or
underlying developmental disorders.
