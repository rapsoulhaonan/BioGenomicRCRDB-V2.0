              <p>Cell Press, an imprint of Elsevier, is a publisher of biomedical journals, including Cell and Neuron. Benjamin Lewin founded Cell in January 1974, under the aegis of MIT Press. He then bought the title and established an independent Cell Press in 1986. The company spun off new journals as follows: Neuron in March, 1988; Immunity in April, 1994; and Molecular Cell in December, 1997. Benjamin Lewin left in October 1999, after having sold Cell Press to Elsevier the previous April.Since that time, Cell Press has launched six new titles: Developmental Cell in July 2001; Cancer Cell in February 2002; Cell Metabolism in January 2005; Cell Host & Microbe in March 2007; Cell Stem Cell in July 2007; and Cell Systems in July 2015.Meanwhile, three additional Elsevier journals have joined the Cell Press group: Current Biology launched in January 1996, which became part of Cell Press in early 2001; Chemistry & Biology launched on April 15, 1994, began a regular publication schedule in September of that year, and joined Cell Press in January 2002; and Structure launched in 1993, which merged with the journal Folding & Design in early 1999. At that point, the name changed to Structure with Folding & Design but reverted to Structure at the beginning of 2001, when the journal joined Cell Press. In October 1995, Cell.com was launched and included tables of contents, abstracts, and information for authors and subscribers. Full-text online versions at Cell.com, Neuron.org, and Immunity.com were launched in July 1997</p>

              <p>Nature is an English multidisciplinary scientific journal, first published on 4 November 1869. It was ranked the world's most cited scientific journal by the Science Edition of the 2010 Journal Citation Reports and is ascribed an impact factor of approximately 38.1, making it one of the world's top academic journals. It is one of the few remaining academic journals that publishes original research across a wide range of scientific fields. Nature claims an online readership of about 3 million unique readers per month. The journal has a weekly circulation of around 53,000 but studies have concluded that on average a single copy is shared by as many as eight people.</p>
			  <p>Research scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make many of the most important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated public. Towards the front of each issue are editorials, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books and arts. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying supplementary material on the journal's website.</p>
			  <p>There are many fields of research in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in Nature. The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Less than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication.</p>
			  <p>In 2007 Nature (together with Science) received the Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanity.</p>

              <p>Oxford University Press (OUP) is the largest university press in the world, and the second oldest after Cambridge University Press. It is a department of the University of Oxford and is governed by a group of 15 academics appointed by the vice-chancellor known as the delegates of the press. They are headed by the secretary to the delegates, who serves as OUP's chief executive and as its major representative on other university bodies. Oxford University has used a similar system to oversee OUP since the 17th century.</p>
			  <p>The university became involved in the print trade around 1480, and grew into a major printer of Bibles, prayer books, and scholarly works. OUP took on the project that became the Oxford English Dictionary in the late 19th century, and expanded to meet the ever-rising costs of the work. As a result, the last hundred years has seen Oxford publish children's books, school text books, music, journals, the World's Classics series, and a best-selling range of English language teaching texts to match its academic and religious titles. Moves into international markets led to OUP opening its own offices outside the United Kingdom, beginning with New York City in 1896. With the advent of computer technology and increasingly harsh trading conditions, the Press's printing house at Oxford was closed in 1989, and its former paper mill at Wolvercote was demolished in 2004. By contracting out its printing and binding operations, the modern OUP publishes some 6,000 new titles around the world each year. As part of a charitable organization, OUP is committed to major financial support of its parent university, and furthers the university's aims of excellence in scholarship, research, and education through its publishing activities.</p>
